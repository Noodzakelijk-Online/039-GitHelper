## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### myapp.exe Issues:

**"Windows protected your PC" message:**
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- This is normal for unsigned executables

**Port 3000 already in use:**
- Close other applications using port 3000
- Or wait a moment and try again

**Antivirus blocks the exe:**
- Add an exception for myapp.exe
- The exe is safe - it's just a packaged Node.js server

### Script Issues:

**"Node.js is not installed" Error:**
- Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Restart your computer after installation

**"Failed to install dependencies" Error:**
- Check your internet connection
- Delete `node_modules` folder and retry

**Browser doesn't open automatically:**
- Manually go to: `http://localhost:3000`

**Permission denied (Linux/Mac):**
- Run: `chmod +x start_git_helper.sh`
